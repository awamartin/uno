# Recommendations

- VScode is a good editor
- gitkraken is a good gui git tool

# To Do

- customisable player names - AM
- uno button/uno challenge rules
- player score table
- player joining half way through gets to play with 0/1 pickup cards
- reset should be hidden unless in debug mode, it's currently unclear that this resets the game and not just the log
