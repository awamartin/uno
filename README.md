# To Do

- challenge, check top of pile instead of checking the colour in the hand and give the next player the colour choice
- reset should be hidden unless in debug mode, it's currently unclear that this resets the game and not just the log
- show play direction (reverse or not reversed) - CC
- make the player's turn more obvious - CC
- customisable player names
- pickup doesnt clear the challenge button
- playing a card on the same card is not easy to see - CC
- sort button for players hand - CC
- uno button/uno challenge rules
- deal notifier - CC
- player score table
- player joining half way through gets to play with 0/1 pickup cards
