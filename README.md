# Things from first trial game

1. +4 followed by +2 resulted in +6.
2. Shouldnt be able to play after game win
3. When Uno in, show coloured row when in Uno, show coloured row when you won the game.
4. Kill player on timeout/disconnect
5. Colour selector click doesnt seem to work on first click.
6. Move pick up button next to sort hand button.
7. Cards in hand gets out of date.
8. +2 played last doesnt go to hand. Did go to first turn next game.
9. Show colour/something in row if person played slapdown, skip etc.
10. pick up doesnt update card hand length
11. You can get first turn after dealing
12. Add Game Counter. Perhaps total row at bottom of table?
13. Remove Log of player tried to play card.
14. Game over and highlight winner at 500.
15. Click wild out of turn, dont show colours.
16. +2, +4 on last turn needs to count in score, and without showing challenge for +4. Ensure it doesnt apply next game! Also ensure challenge doesnt show next game.
17. Two people can win, which causes score of others to double. Resolved if noone can play after win.
